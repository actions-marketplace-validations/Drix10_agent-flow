# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- **Branding.** The README now opens with one sentence and one outcome (*Leave your coding agent alone with your repo. Come back to a reviewed pull request, not a mess.*), shows real `status` output, gives one install command and two follow-up steps, and puts the other install routes, the CI snippet and the command list under collapsed sections. A short "From one real repo" block gives measured numbers from five days of use, including the false alarms. The same sentence is the description in `package.json`, the Claude and Codex plugin manifests, the marketplace file, `gemini-extension.json` and the GitHub About text. No behaviour changed.
- **Enrolled in Anthropic's OSS Scanner.** `.oss-scanner/Dockerfile` builds and tests the project the way CI does, and `.oss-scanner/threat_model.md` tells the scanner to treat the agent as the attacker, which components matter, how we rate severity and which gaps `SECURITY.md` already admits. Neither ships in the npm package. No behaviour changed.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-10-08

Found by reading a real repository's history (the Hypothesis Arena: 294 role runs and about $83 over five days) and by installing the published package on real Gemini CLI 0.62 and Codex 0.160:

- **QA no longer repeats the gates.** When QA's commands are exactly the gates' commands (you didn't pass `--commands`) and every one just passed on this commit, `run` records the QA result from the gate logs and doesn't launch a QA role: in the arena QA re-ran the gates on 63 issues for 8 hours and $11 and caught nothing the gates had passed, and a live run spent 13 minutes per QA pass on it. The audit line says `harness: gates`, the completion binding accepts it like any QA run, and `pipeline.qa_reuses_gates: false` always launches QA. The trade is the re-run QA does to tell a flaky test from a broken one.
- **A plugin or skill install no longer looks like protection.** The Claude plugin installs the skills only, so a user who stopped there had no guard and nothing said so. The bootstrap and orchestrator skills now start with `agent-flow status` and tell the user plainly when it reports no guard hook, with the one command that wires it. The README says the same beside the new npm install commands (`npm install --global`, `--save-dev`) and gains an npm downloads badge.
- **`status` collapses a long backlog.** The arena had 27 finished issues, each two lines. Past four of a kind (ready, in progress) the screen prints one summary line with the issue numbers and what to run; `status --json` still lists every row.
- **The guard no longer blocks writes that are inside the worktree.** On Windows, Git Bash writes `C:\…` as `/c/…`, which node reads as a path on the current drive, outside the worktree: 16 of the arena's 28 confinement blocks were that. `/c/…` and `/cygdrive/c/…` are now read as the drive they name. A redirect to PowerShell's `$null` (like `/dev/null`) is no longer refused as an unresolvable target. A variable that may name a real file (`> $OUT`) still is.
- **A guard block records what it blocked.** `guard_block` audit lines gain `target`: the shell command or file path, one line, at most 240 characters, with tokens, bearer headers and `password=`-style values replaced by `[REDACTED]`. Before, 50 of 53 read-only blocks in the arena said only "output redirection to a file", so a false positive could not be told from an attack.
- **Finished work that was merged by hand clears itself.** An issue at "ready" or waiting on review stays in the list until someone dismisses it, even after its branch is merged: the arena had 34, 30 dismissed one at a time with the same reason. `status` now folds the ones whose reviewed commit is already in the default branch into one line (the commit comes from the audit log, so it works after the branch is deleted), and `state dismiss --merged [--reason …]` drops them all (it also recognises a squash merge, which the quick `status` pass does not). A just-started issue is never counted, and a run that is working on one is left alone. `status` stays quick: one `git rev-list`, not one git call per issue.
- **The implementer and QA skills say never to end a turn waiting on a background job.** The arena's #100053 ended a turn with "I'll commit once the notification shows all four pass" and the run was rejected as a malformed report.
- **A QA timeout is no longer a round for the Implementer.** In a live run on the arena, QA's own time limit killed one command (exit 124, also on the re-run) while the machine was under load; QA reported `failed` with no reason, which means "the tests failed", so a second implementer round started for something no code change could fix. When every failing QA command was killed by a timeout, the run now stops as `qa_environment` and says which commands; one genuine failure beside a timeout still goes back to the Implementer.
- **A new test that no gate runs is reported.** In the arena the agent added a test and the one CI line for it, review and QA passed, and the test had run nowhere in the pipeline: its gates list tests by name in the protected manifest, so only a person can add it. `run` now warns (log, result and pull request body) when a file the change adds is a test that no gate names. It doesn't send it back to the Implementer, which can't fix it.
- **An invalid first report is kept.** The correction retry reuses the same file names, so what the first attempt printed was overwritten and about a dozen such failures in the arena could not be inspected afterwards. It is now kept as `<role>-r<N>.attempt1.raw` beside the retry.
- Verified, not changed: the Gemini CLI extension installs from the v1.2.5 release with all six skills; `codex plugin marketplace add Drix10/agent-flow` then `codex plugin add agent-flow@agent-flow-marketplace` installs 1.2.5 with all six; `npx skills add Drix10/agent-flow --list` finds all six. (Codex failed on a very long working-directory path on Windows: the clone exceeded the 260-character limit, a property of that path, not of the repository.)

- **The Claude Code plugin is now the skills folder alone** (`plugins/agent-flow`, with its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; the marketplace entry points there). The directory scans whatever its source path holds, and with the whole repository as the source it flagged tests, fixtures and the CLI itself. Added the plugin icon (`plugins/agent-flow/.claude-plugin/icon.png`, 1024 px). Reworded scanner false positives in the skills (the directory reads `$PWD` plus any URL in one file as a credential going to a server, so `launch.md` uses `$(pwd)`); the same file's runner script no longer spreads `process.env` into the role it launches (the role inherits the environment either way, and `KEY=VALUE` arguments are now set on the runner's own environment). Reworded scanner false positives: a docs URL beside `$PWD` in `launch.md`, and `eval` beside "shell" in the reviewer skill. The guard hook still comes from `install --harness claude`; the plugin never wired it.

- Removed `docs/DISTRIBUTION.md` and the root `plugin.json`. The root manifest was in the agent-plugins.org format, which Claude reads none of (the directory validator said so), and `plugins/agent-flow/plugin.json` already carries the same manifest for Codex. The plugin keyword `trust-loop` became `guardrails`, `SETUP.md` names the renamed skill in its non-Claude wording, and `docs/EXTENSIONS-VS-SKILLS.md` went (nothing linked to it).

## [1.2.5] - 2026-10-07

- **Fixed:** the `/debt` prompt failed to load in Pi — its frontmatter `description` held a bare `": "` (`(lean: comments)`), the same nested-mapping rejection as the implementer skill. The value is quoted, and the prompt test now enforces quoting everywhere, not just in skills.

- **Codex plugin + distribution tracker:** `plugins/agent-flow/plugin.json` (portable manifest, version pinned by `scripts/check-versions.mjs`) bundles copies of all six skills, and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` exposes it as a repo marketplace, so `codex plugin marketplace add Drix10/agent-flow` installs the skills into Codex. `tests/dogfood.test.js` fails if the plugin's skill copies drift from `skills/`; `tests/package.test.js` checks the marketplace entry. `docs/DISTRIBUTION.md` tracks every directory/marketplace, its state and its next step.
- **Installable from skills.sh:** `npx skills add Drix10/agent-flow` discovers all six skills with no packaging changes (verified live against the skills CLI); the README leads with a 30-second try (`npx @drix10/agent-flow scan`, read-only, nothing installed) and documents the skills.sh command. `tests/package.test.js` pins the install surface: every directory under `skills/` is a skill, and the README names the command.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-10-06

Lean mode, a session briefing, more hosts and a safer uninstall, and the bugs found while reviewing the rest of the code. What is and isn't claimed for lean mode: [docs/LEAN.md](docs/LEAN.md).

- **`pipeline.lean` (`off`, `lite` by default, `full`):** the Implementer and Reviewer are told to make the smallest correct change. At `lite`: reuse before writing, fix the root cause (grep every caller), leave one runnable check for non-trivial logic, mark a deliberate shortcut with a `lean:` comment and list it in the report, never lean away validation, error handling, security or accessibility. At `full`: also climb the ladder (needed at all, repo, standard library, platform, installed dependency, one line, minimum) and the Reviewer blocks an avoidable new dependency. `skills/implementer/references/native-first.md` is a lookup of what the platform, the standard library and the database already do. Read from the default branch, so a branch can't switch it off for its own review. The reviewer's lens tags findings `delete`/`stdlib`/`native`/`reuse`/`yagni`/`shrink` and reports `net_lines_removable`; the implementer report gains `shortcuts`, which `run --pr` lists in the pull request. Whether it shrinks what a model writes in a given repo is not measured here.
- **`agent-flow debt`** reads every `lean:` comment (a `ponytail:` one is read too) back from the code with its ceiling and upgrade trigger, flags those that name none, and has `--json` and `--fail-on-no-trigger`. `status` shows the count; the Gardener gains `/debt` and `/audit-lean` (and prompts for both). A marker inside a string literal (a fixture) is text, not a comment.
- **`agent-flow uninstall [--harness] [--yes] [--keep-runtime] [--keep-hook]`** takes out what `install` wrote and nothing else. Previews until `--yes`. Unedited skills, agents, rules files, the OpenCode plugin and the vendored runtime go; an edited one is kept and named; only agent-flow's own entries leave the hook files (your other hooks and settings stay, an unparseable file is untouched); a skills folder shared by several harnesses stays until the last one goes; `AGENTS.md`, the manifest, CODEOWNERS, the baseline and the pipeline's state are never touched. A pipeline role can't run it.
- **A session briefing.** `agent-flow brief` says what is protected, review-only and always blocked, which checks must pass and how many issues wait on a person: facts only, never an issue's free text. `install` wires it as `SessionStart` (and `SubagentStart` on Claude Code) for Claude Code, and `SessionStart`/`sessionStart` for Codex and Cursor; `--no-brief` leaves it out, `update` adds it to an existing install. It answers in the shape each harness reads (and Copilot, Qoder and ZCode if one is wired by hand), never reads stdin, never fails.
- **`agent-flow statusline`** is one line for Claude Code's `statusLine` (guard on or OFF, how many need you, are ready, are working); `install --statusline` sets it only when none is set.
- **`agent-flow mcp`**, a zero-dependency read-only MCP server on stdio: status, pipeline state, classify, debt, doctor, audit summary, gates and the brief, as tools and a prompt, for any MCP client. Every tool is one of a short list of read-only CLI commands with validated arguments.
- **`pipeline.isolate_roles`** launches each role with `--setting-sources project,local`, so a plugin or hook installed globally on the machine can't add context to a role. Off by default.
- **More hosts:** `install --harness cline|kiro|qoder` (a rules file, plus skills in `.agents/skills`) and `swival|factory|commandcode` (skills folders), instruction-tier and listed as such in the harness matrix, with paths that were not run live here.
- **The guard no longer hangs on input that never arrives.** A wrapper that swallows the piped JSON used to leave the hook waiting until the harness killed it, which lets the call through. It waits 10 s (`AGENT_FLOW_HOOK_STDIN_MS`) and refuses wherever protection is configured; the stop gate and the badge are bounded too (FM-22).
- **Fixed: re-running `install` stacked another guard hook** for Codex, Cursor and Gemini when the runtime was vendored (the "is this ours" check only knew the `node_modules` path), so the guard ran once per install on every tool call. A re-install now replaces ours, and `update` leaves a customised guard hook alone with a note.
- **Fixed: `install --harness claude` overwrote a user's own hook** whose name merely contained `agent-flow` and `guard` (a `./scripts/agent-flow-guard.sh` in `PreToolUse` was replaced by agent-flow's command). "Ours" now means "runs agent-flow's own binary" (the project copy or the vendored runtime), for install, the briefing, `uninstall` and the status badge alike.
- **Fixed:** `update` treated every harness that shares `.agents/skills` as installed (it would have written rules files for ones nobody installed); installed harnesses are now told apart by the install record and their own wiring. The install record no longer forgets what a sibling harness wrote.
- **Fixed: piped output could be cut short.** The CLI called `process.exit()` right after a large write (`status --json`, `classify`), which can truncate output on a pipe; it now lets stdout drain first.
- **Fewer tokens spent on agent-flow's own instructions** (see [docs/LEAN.md](docs/LEAN.md#spending-fewer-tokens-on-the-instructions-themselves)): skill descriptions 3,285 to 1,969 characters; the orchestrator skill 15.2 KB to 3.9 KB with its manual procedure moved to `references/manual.md`; the implementer, reviewer and QA skills tightened, and told to be terse; QA keeps the first 50 and last 100 lines of a long log; the starter `DOCS_INDEX.md` and the rules files shortened; agents are told to run `agent-flow brief` instead of reading the manifest; the MCP server cuts answers at 20,000 characters. `tests/token-budget.test.js` pins the ceilings.
- **`doctor` warns when a context file is heavy:** an `.md` context file over 150 lines or about 9 KB is named with its size in tokens (a warning, never a failure; `context_weight` in `--json`). Bootstrap now asks for under 60 lines per module.
- **Fixed: the MCP server's input buffer was unbounded.** A client line with no end grew memory without limit; it is now refused past 1 MB and dropped to its newline, a batch is capped at 50, and the next request still works.
- **Fixed:** `brief` loaded the manifest twice (once per trust level) and now once; the `status` shortcut scan has a 1.5 s budget and says when it is partial; a pre-record install in the shared skills folder is read as the generic `agents` target; the review-violation message names the CRLF trap beside the missing-final-newline one.
- **Fixed (review comments on the pull request):** added lines that couldn't be read (a diff past the buffer) were treated as none, so a risky CI line could pass unchecked; they are now a `review_violations` entry. `check-versions` let a release tag that isn't shaped like a version (`v1.2`) through to publish; every tag that isn't the version now fails. A test left its polling timer running on early exit.
- **Release hygiene:** `scripts/check-versions.mjs` (every version file, the CHANGELOG section and the docs' action tag agree; on a release tag it equals the tag) runs in CI and before publishing; `tests/release-hygiene.test.js` pins the load-bearing rules in every skill, prompt and harness copy, and the frontmatter every skill needs. A frontmatter value with a bare `": "` must be quoted, or strict YAML readers (Pi) reject the skill as a nested mapping.
- **Fixed:** the implementer skill failed to load in Pi — its frontmatter `description` held a bare `": "` (`(agent/issue-N): smallest…`), which strict YAML reads as a nested mapping. The value is now quoted in `skills/` and the `.agents`, `.cursor` and `.gemini` copies.
- **Skills renamed to `agent-flow-*`** (`bootstrap` → `agent-flow-bootstrap`, `gardener` → `agent-flow-gardener`, `implementer` → `agent-flow-implementer`, `invoking-agents` → `agent-flow-invoking-agents`, `qa` → `agent-flow-qa`, `reviewer` → `agent-flow-reviewer`): one generic word shares a flat skill namespace with every other package on every harness (Pi keeps the first discovered and warns; Claude Code project skills collide silently), so the unprefixed names are retired. Skill directories, frontmatter names, prompts, launch procedures, docs and the Claude reviewer's `skills:` field use the new names. `update` removes a pre-rename dir that is still exactly what install wrote and keeps (named) one you edited; `uninstall` and a fresh `install` do the same. Role identifiers (`AGENT_FLOW_ROLE=implementer`, …) are unchanged.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-10-04

Unattended runs no longer stop at every CI change. Found while working out how an agent should get a new test into a CI list without calling a person back for something small.

- **`review_paths` (manifest):** paths agents may change by **adding lines**, usually `.github/workflows/`. The guard lets a role edit them (the one entry of its agent-config list that a manifest can open: skills, hooks, harness settings, the trust files, the manifest and `protected_paths` stay shut, and a path in both lists is protected). The change is classified `medium` with `human_approval_required`, so the pull request is a **draft that waits for a person** and is never auto-merged (`review_required` in Needs Me, with the files to read); the run itself carries on through review, gates and QA instead of stopping. Default is none: `init` suggests it (and no longer suggests `.github/workflows/` as a protected path, which would stop every run), and bootstrap asks once.
- **Shape check on the diff:** an edited or deleted line, a binary change, or an added CI line that reaches secrets (`secrets.*`, `secrets: inherit`), uses the job token, runs on `pull_request_target` or `workflow_run`, widens a permission (`… : write`), uses a `self-hosted` runner, pipes a download into a shell, pulls in a third-party action (`uses:` outside `actions/` and `./`), or drops event text into a script (`${{ github.event… }}`) is a `review_violations` entry. `run` hands it to the Implementer as findings (like a `policy` rule) and escalates at the round cap; it can add a line instead of changing one. CI code runs when a pull request opens, before anyone reads it, which is why the second list exists. It is a pattern list, not a sandbox: keep deploy secrets in environments that need approval.
- **A branch can't widen it.** `review_paths` is read from the default branch's manifest (else the last committed copy), like `gates` and `policy`; `trustedManifest` says when a working-copy edit is ignored, and a deleted or emptied working copy doesn't close it either. The Pi guard re-reads the manifest every 5 seconds as well as when the file changes, since the committed copy changes on a commit without touching the file.
- A command that names a review-only workflow (`git add .github/workflows/ci.yml`) is judged by what it resolves to, but only a listed pattern that itself sits in the workflows folder vouches for the mention: a broad one such as `*.md` can't launder a workflow file named beside it.
- `classify` prints the review-only paths and violations; `status` shows how many there are and, for finished work waiting on review, says to merge it and close the issue instead of sending it back; `run` says the same. Skills (implementer, reviewer, orchestrator, bootstrap) and `SETUP.md` say what is allowed and what to escalate.

Found by reviewing the rest of the code while doing this:

- **A hostile or huge role output could hang report validation.** Finding the last JSON object in free text rescanned to the end from every `{`, which is quadratic: a few hundred thousand unclosed braces from a role (or a log full of them) ran for minutes. It now reads only the last 2 MB and stops after a fixed amount of work.
- **Gate logs no longer pile up.** Every gate run left up to 5 MB per gate, and a stop gate runs on each stop. Once `.agent-flow/gates/` holds more than 500 files, those older than 30 days are deleted (never this run's).
- `atomicWrite` left a partial `.tmp` file when the write itself failed (a full disk); it now removes it. The Pi guard's root cache no longer grows with every directory a session visits.
- Test fix: the fake npm registry in `tests/update.test.js` printed its port with `console.log`, which colours numbers when `FORCE_COLOR` is set and made the URL invalid.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-10-03

Found by running `agent-flow run` unattended on a real repository (Hypothesis Arena, Windows):

- **Script files no longer bypass the guard.** The guard checked a command but not a script file the command ran, so an edit to a protected path could be put in a file and run from there. A script that differs from the default branch's copy (new, edited, committed only on the issue branch, or outside the repo) is now checked like the command it contains. The repo's unchanged scripts stay trusted, so gates and tests run as before.
- **Prose no longer looks like a protected path.** On Windows and macOS, a Python heredoc saying "the stage's rules" was blocked as a write to the protected file `STAGE`, which pushed agents toward the script-file workaround. In program text a protected name now counts only as a path in a string literal.
- **The rule files are guarded.** The Implementer can't edit `CONTEXT_MANIFEST.json`. A diff that changes it or `.risk-baseline.json` is classified critical, so it needs a person and is never auto-merged. `agent-flow codeowners` and `doctor` now cover both files.
- **Merged work can be marked done.** Once a pull request was merged and its branch deleted, `state update --state Completed` parked the issue in Needs Me (`unreviewed_commits`). The approved commit now counts as the tip when the default branch holds it, either as an ancestor or as a squash merge with the same patch. A different change merged under the issue still does not count.
- **Usage limits wait instead of parking the issue.** A role that hits "You've hit your session limit · resets 5:10pm (…)" used to go to Needs Me and stay there. `run` now waits for the reset and runs the role again, up to three times and only within `--limit-wait <hours>` (default 6, 0 never waits). Further away than that, it escalates as `usage_limit` with the time to re-run.
- **`doctor` names tests no gate runs.** Where a gate lists a directory's tests one by one (`for t in test_a test_b; do …`), a test file in that directory that no gate lists is reported. That is how a new test never ran and a deleted one stayed listed. A gate that hands the whole directory to a runner is not second-guessed.
- **The audit log is anchored off the machine.** `.agent-flow/audit.jsonl` exists only where the pipeline runs, so anyone who could write it could rewrite the whole chain consistently. A pull request opened by `run --pr` now carries the log's head hash, and `audit verify --anchor <hash>` proves the local log still contains it.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-02

- **`run` roles can read their issue folder and worktree.** An Implementer that `cd`s into its worktree lost Claude Code's permission to read `issue.md` (3 of 4 live runs on a real repository stopped with a permission error). `run` now passes `--add-dir` for the issue folder and the worktree to every role.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-02

- **`agent-flow run` is the short path from task to checked work.** Give it a testable task or issue number. Claude Code runs implementation, mechanical risk classification, review, required gates and QA in separate processes. By default the result stays in a local worktree; `--pr` pushes and opens a PR, while `--auto-merge` is an additional opt-in gated by `pipeline.auto_merge_low_risk`. `--dry-run` shows the plan and setup gaps without launching roles. Invalid manifests, missing GitHub auth and invalid timeout values are caught before role calls.
- **`agent-flow status` summarizes repository readiness** across protection, context, checks and work waiting on the user.
- Task text is XML-escaped before it is placed inside the untrusted issue boundary. Auto-merge defaults off in the CLI, even when the repository allows it.
- Updated Quickstart, README and orchestration skill to make the CLI the first path on Claude Code and keep the harness-specific skill procedure for other agents.
- Added end-to-end fake-agent coverage for the run loop, resumptions, report correction, risk escalation, gate failures, protected paths, QA tree mutation and PR creation.
- **Resume is trustworthy.** A saved report is reused only if its role finished before the phase the issue stopped in, so sending an escalated issue back to `implement` runs every role again instead of replaying a rejected result. A resumed round gets the report that ended the previous round as its findings (it used to get `none`). Once QA passes the issue is checkpointed as `publish`, so `run N --pr` after a local run publishes without paying for another review or QA.
- **One run per issue.** A lock in the artifacts folder refuses a second `run` for the same issue and takes over a lock left by a dead process.
- **Ctrl-C is safe.** An interrupted `run` stops the agent and everything it started (the whole process tree, on Windows and POSIX), releases the lock, and says how to continue. A timeout now stops the tree too, not just the agent.
- **Checks on what the Implementer hands over.** Uncommitted work is sent back as findings (it would be reviewed here but missing from the pushed branch), and a branch with no changes escalates as `no_changes` instead of opening an empty pull request.
- **QA mutation check no longer holds files in memory.** Modified and untracked files are hashed in 1 MiB pieces; the staged blobs and `git status` are included. The manual skill's shell snippet uses the same fingerprint (with `git hash-object`, so it works on macOS).
- **Windows launch fixes.** A line break in a prompt ended the `cmd.exe` command line and silently dropped the rest; it is now a space. Validator text is flattened and bounded, a session id is used only if it is a plain token, and QA command lists over 800 characters are passed in a file (a command line is limited to about 8,000 characters).
- **Task and state fixes.** New task text replaces files left by an earlier attempt that never started (it used to inherit the old task), issue numbers skip any with saved artifacts or a worktree, a budget stop is reported as `budget_exceeded` instead of a round cap, and the pull request targets the base branch by name (not `origin/main`).
- **Found by running it live on a real repository** (Hypothesis Arena, a C++/Python repo with 12 protected paths and 7 critical areas, on Windows):
  - On Windows, Claude has a separate `PowerShell` tool. The roles allowed only `Bash`, so the first command was denied and a turn wasted, and the read-only Reviewer's deny-list named only `Bash`, so it still had a working shell (a live call confirmed it ran a PowerShell command under plan mode). PowerShell is now allowed for the Implementer and QA and denied to the Reviewer, in `run` and in the manual launch recipe.
  - A Node `DEP0190` deprecation warning printed at the start of every real run on Windows (the preflight `claude --version` check passed arguments alongside `shell: true`).
  - Preflight now names the manifest problem ("missing `context_files` array") instead of only counting it.
  - Resuming an issue whose work is already reviewed, gated and tested takes seconds and costs nothing: it no longer re-runs the gates (2.5 minutes there) or announces "implementing" for work it isn't doing.
  - A critical change used to finish with the same line as a trivial one. It now prints the risk and says to read the diff before publishing. When `pipeline.models.high_reasoning` is not set, `run` and `status` say the critical review runs on the same model as everything else instead of implying a stronger one (a configured tier is passed as `--model`, verified live: Sonnet for the Implementer, Opus for the critical review).
  - `status` calls an issue that passed review, gates and QA "ready" (with the command to publish), not "in progress".
  - **`agent-flow state dismiss --issue N --reason "…"`** lets a person drop an issue they handled by hand, or no longer want, from the list. Its files and the audit trail stay; it is refused while a run is working on it and is a person-only action (every role is refused, the orchestrator too). Before, such an issue stayed in "needs you" forever.
  - The guard's message for a command that edits files and also names a protected path now says to run the read or the run of that path as a separate command, instead of only "escalate". The Implementer in the trial recovered on its own, but a model told to escalate may not.
- **Found by independent review of the above:** Ctrl-C during a blocking git, gate or push call now stops the run at once (it used to read as a failed gate and use up a round). The run lock is created already holding its content, so a second process can't mistake it for a leftover, and it is refreshed every 30 seconds, so a long run is never taken for a dead one (a lock nobody has refreshed for six hours is stale; a taken-over lock is never deleted by its former holder). Files a gate or QA writes are no longer blamed on the next round's Implementer. Files from an abandoned attempt at a round are set aside as `*.prev` instead of outranking the new attempt's findings. A later `run N --pr` keeps `Closes #N` for a GitHub issue. `%NAME%` in a prompt is no longer expanded by `cmd.exe` on Windows, and QA commands containing `%`, quotes or line breaks travel in a file. A late error from a role that is already running no longer discards its result.
- **Output.** `--json` keeps stdout a single JSON document (progress goes to stderr, and a missing-setup error is JSON too). `status` prints the full command to send an escalated issue back, and describes auto-merge as the opt-in it is. Cost is shown with its `$`.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-10-02

Found by asking how a vendored install ever learns about a newer version (it didn't).

- **`agent-flow update [--yes] [--check] [--force]`.** Brings the skills, reviewer agents, hook wiring and the vendored runtime up to the running version. `install` now records what it wrote (`<harness dir>/agent-flow-install.json`); `update` replaces only files that still match that record, keeps and lists anything you edited, never downgrades, and previews unless given `--yes`. `--check` exits 10 when an update is available, for a scheduled CI job (a ready workflow is in `docs/ADOPTION.md`). The vendored copy can't update itself and prints the `npx @drix10/agent-flow@latest update --yes` command. A repo installed before this release has no record, so its first update needs `--force` once.
- **`doctor` tells you when agent-flow is behind**, as one dim line for humans at a terminal: when a newer CLI finds an older vendored runtime (no network), or when the npm registry has a newer version (one GET, 2.2 s cap, cached for a day in `~/.agent-flow/`). Never in `--json`/SARIF output, CI, the guard or the pre-commit hook; `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`, `AGENT_FLOW_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`, `AGENT_FLOW_OFFLINE=1` and `--offline` turn it off. The GitHub Code Owner lookup added in 1.1.6 now also skips itself in CI.
- **Docs now say what the network does.** `README.md` and `SECURITY.md` claimed "no network calls"; both are corrected to name the two optional, read-only lookups in `doctor` (npm registry version, `gh` branch-protection).
- `update` is a setup action like `install`: no pipeline role may run it. It leaves a customized guard hook alone (with a note) unless `--force`, treats hook wiring that is out of date as an update on its own, and compares the OpenCode plugin with the same hash format `install` records. Fixed on the way: a dry run of the vendoring step no longer stops the real copy.
- Install-style table in `docs/ADOPTION.md` ("Keeping it current"): npm, npx and vendored, and how each is told about and applies an update.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-10-02

Found by running bootstrap on a real C++/Python repo with no `package.json`, on Windows.

- **Any language, no npm.** `install` copies a ~0.5 MB runtime to `.agent-flow-runtime/` for the guard hooks (Claude, Gemini, Codex, Cursor) when agent-flow isn't in the project's `node_modules`, or with `--vendor`. It used to refuse and tell you to `npm install -D`. Commit the folder; the pre-commit hook finds it too. The guard treats it as hook wiring, and `audit-risk`, `scan` and `classify` ignore it. The skills no longer claim a devDependency.
- `install` keeps `.agent-flow/` (audit log, gate logs, backups) out of git through `.git/info/exclude`, and its next steps say what to commit.
- **Behavior change on Windows: string gates run in Git Bash, not `cmd.exe`.** Gate commands come from CI files and READMEs, which are POSIX; under `cmd.exe` they failed and looked like test failures. A gate written for `cmd.exe` (`.\scripts\check.bat`, `set X=1 && …`) now needs `AGENT_FLOW_SHELL=cmd.exe`, or an `os`-specific rewrite. Details: String gates went through `cmd.exe`, so every POSIX command (`./build.sh`, a `for` loop, the commands `scan` reads from CI) failed and looked like a test failure. `AGENT_FLOW_SHELL` overrides. A command the shell itself can't start is now an environment error (exit 2); a 126/127 from inside a script is still that script's failure.
- **`os` on a gate** (`["linux"]`): elsewhere the gate is reported as skipped, never as a pass, and CI judges it. For builds that need a Linux toolchain or a POSIX filesystem.
- **`agent-flow manifest sync [--yes]`** rebuilds `context_files` from the context files on disk (new `AGENTS.md` files, install's `CLAUDE.md`, the paths their prose names) and keeps `protected_paths`, `risk_boundaries`, `gates` and every other key. Bootstrap and the gardener use it instead of editing references by hand. Roles without `bootstrap_write` can't run it.
- `scan` finds commands in CI workflow steps, including each plain line of a `run: |` block (loops, continuations and lines with variables are left out), and in `build.sh`/`test.sh`, so a repo with no `package.json` or Makefile no longer reports none. Three or more sibling commands collapse into one `…/<name>.py (N files)` line.
- **CODEOWNERS without the friction.** A missing or partial `CODEOWNERS` is now one quiet note, not a warning: the guard and pre-commit hook already protect against local agents, and CODEOWNERS only matters for pull requests pushed from elsewhere. `agent-flow codeowners [--yes] [--owner @x]` previews, then appends the lines (owner from `origin`); an existing file is appended to, never replaced. When the lines are in place and a logged-in `gh` is available, `doctor` also reports whether GitHub really requires Code Owner review (rulesets and classic protection); with no `gh`, no login or no network it says nothing, never asks for a token, and `--offline` / `AGENT_FLOW_OFFLINE=1` skips the call. Solo repos are told that requiring it blocks their own PRs.
- `doctor --allow-stale` reports stale context without failing, and `doctor --allow-stale` reports stale context without failing (for CI on every push; broken paths, schema problems and placeholders still fail). Without it, a repo's CI went red 30 days after setup with no change.
- The OpenCode plugin finds the CLI relative to itself (the vendored runtime or `node_modules`) instead of the absolute path of whichever copy ran `install`, so it works in every clone.
- Bootstrap skill: the secrets gate offers fake / real / keep-flagged instead of only stopping; a new gates step (where each can run, timeouts, `on_stop`); glob and highest-level-wins rules spelled out; `manifest sync` for `context_files`; Phase 6 runs the gates and sorts every failure; CODEOWNERS and CI steps without Node in the project; the repo's own rules bind bootstrap.
- Guard: an unquoted glob that expands to an env file or a `deny_read` path (`cat .e*`) is a secret read, like naming the file.
- Guard: a recursive search (`grep -r`, `rg --hidden`) over a directory that holds an env file or a `deny_read` path is a secret read; `rg` without `--hidden` skips dotfiles as it does itself.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-10-01

- Read each vendor's hook docs and source and fixed what they contradicted: Gemini's hook now matches every tool (the allow-list named a tool that doesn't exist and missed others); Cursor's Windows BOM on stdin no longer makes the guard fail open, and Cursor's Delete tool counts as a write; the OpenCode plugin is one flat file with no SDK import (v1 and v2 load it; it no longer writes `.opencode/package.json` or depends on `@opencode/plugin`). `docs/HARNESS-MATRIX.md` says, per harness, what is live-verified and what is docs-verified only, with the caveats each vendor's docs give (untrusted folders, fail-open exits, headless modes).

- Codex guard hook live-verified on Linux/WSL (protected write, `--no-verify` commit and hook-config write all blocked); docs note that Codex's bypass-hook-trust / full-access options disable enforcement.
- Guard: PowerShell writes are judged like their POSIX twins — named parameters in any order (`-LiteralPath`, `-Destination`, …), Windows `\` paths, `Copy-Item` writes only its destination, and .NET `[IO.File]::Write*` calls count as writes. A live Codex-on-Windows probe found `Set-Content -LiteralPath .codex/hooks.json …` slipped through.
- Guard blocks also print a JSON deny (`permissionDecision`) on stdout besides exit 2 + stderr; set `AGENT_FLOW_GUARD_JSON_ONLY=1` to deny by JSON with exit 0 (experiment for a harness that ignores exit 2).
- `agent-flow sandbox [--ro] [--no-net] [--hide-home] [--allow <dir>] -- <cmd>` runs a command under bubblewrap (read-only filesystem except the worktree), an OS-level boundary the hook cannot give. Linux/WSL only.

- `doctor` warns (never fails) when `protected_paths` have no CODEOWNERS entry, since only the host can stop a pull request editing them.
- Guard: recognises Codex/OpenCode patch payloads, Gemini `replace`, argv-form shells, `workdir`/`dir_path`, and protects the Gemini/Codex/Cursor/OpenCode hook wiring from edits.

- `install --harness gemini|codex|cursor` also installs the guard as a pre-tool hook; the guard understands Cursor's tool-less `beforeShellExecution`/`beforeReadFile` payloads. Live verification pending.
- `policy.deny_commands: ["infra"]` shorthand accepted (it used to load no rule at all).

- `install --harness opencode`: OpenCode guard plugin (`tool.execute.before`), fails closed. Live verification pending.
- Guard: `mv x ~/` no longer flagged when the repo lives under the home directory (found by a live OpenCode run).

### Added
- **Cross-vendor roles.** `pipeline.harness_by_role` (`{"reviewer": "codex"}`) runs a role on another harness than the orchestrator's; the orchestrator skill reads it into `env.sh`, the verdict still goes through the schema, round cap and audit chain, and a missing CLI is Needs Me, not a silent fallback. On the last allowed round the Implementer uses `pipeline.models.high_reasoning`.
- **`policy.deny_commands`** (opt-in): presets `database` and `infra` plus custom regexes that the guard refuses in every agent session, with an additive floor from the default branch and the usual human override.
- **Bounded stop gate for interactive Claude Code sessions.** Gates marked `on_stop: true` run from a Stop hook (`agent-flow gates stop`, installed with `install --harness claude --stop-gate`) when the tree changed since the last pass. It holds a session back at most `pipeline.max_stop_blocks` (default 2, max 5) times per turn, then lets it stop and records `stop_gate_exhausted`. Gates come from the default branch's manifest; `.agent-flow/stop-gate.json` and `.agent-flow/gates/` are tamper-proof.
- **Per-issue cost cap.** `pipeline.max_cost_usd`: once an issue's role runs have cost that much, `state update` (and the Pi `state_update` tool) escalates the next new phase or round to Needs Me `budget_exceeded` with the cost per round (exit 3 in the CLI). Counts only harnesses that report cost; `audit summary` now shows how many runs reported none.
- **`doctor` checks commands, links and commits, not just paths.** `npm|pnpm run <script>` and `npm test` against the nearest `package.json`, `make <target>` against the Makefile, `just <recipe>` against the justfile (each with a did-you-mean), relative markdown links (case-exact) and commits cited as `commit <sha>`. Skips what it can't resolve: workspace/`-C` flags, `cd`, variables, yarn/bun binaries, shallow clones, fixture directories. New SARIF rules `broken-link` and `unknown-commit`.
- **Verdicts are bound to the commit they judged.** `role_run` and `gate_run` audit lines record the tip of `agent/issue-N`. `state update --state Completed` exits 3 and records Needs Me `unreviewed_commits` unless the round's approved review, passed QA and every required gate name the current tip. No skip flag. Runs recorded before this version carry no `head` and aren't compared.

### Changed
- **`gates`, `policy`, `secret_scan` and `pipeline` are read from the default branch's manifest** (falling back to the last committed copy), not the working copy an agent can edit; `risk_boundaries` may be added to but not removed. `gates list` and `check-staged` say when the working copy differs. A human iterating locally can set `AGENT_FLOW_TRUST_WORKING_MANIFEST=1`. This corrects 1.1.4's "a branch can't edit the gate that judges it", which held for gates only on the main checkout.

### Security
- **The guard now refuses `rm -rf ~`, `$HOME`, `/` wherever the repository is** (`catastrophic-delete`) and commands that build words from `${IFS}` (`obfuscated-command`). The red-team corpus grew by 30 cases drawn from gstack's `careful`, block-dangerous-git and the new presets, and a test asserts blocks exit 2 through the real hook, never 1.
- **`git push origin HEAD` reached the default branch.** `HEAD`, `@`, an empty target and dynamic targets (`HEAD:$(…)`, `HEAD:refs/heads/$B`, globs) now get the same `explicit-refspec` block as a bare `git push`, because the guard can't see which branch is checked out. Name the branch: `git push origin agent/issue-N`.
- **Roles could spawn agents through the harness's own tool.** `Task`, `Agent`, `subagent` and similar tools are refused for every role except the orchestrator, matching the shell rule for `claude -p`.
- **Read-only roles: more write paths recognised.** Archive extraction (`tar x`, `unzip`, `7z x`, `gunzip`…), `awk` redirects and `system()`, `php -r` writes, `sqlite3` mutations and `python -c` with `os.system`/`subprocess`. Listing an archive (`tar t`, `unzip -l`) stays allowed.

### Fixed (docs)
- `HARNESS-MATRIX.md`: the "Protected paths" row showed ✅ for harnesses that only have the pre-commit hook; it now says so. The Codex reviewer cell no longer claims a live write-block probe that was not run. The Gemini reviewer cell and `.gemini/agents/reviewer.md` now match `launch.md` (default approval mode; Gemini has no `plan` mode in this version), and the matrix states that Gemini's Implementer and QA run under `yolo`.
- README: "separate processes" is qualified with "when the pipeline runs as documented" (FM-18).

## [1.1.4] - 2026-09-29

Two reviews of the guard (one on a repo with an append-only ledger, frozen specs and secrets; one on the fixes to that) closed 16 of 43 attack cases that used to pass, and made agent-flow safe to adopt in a repository that already has rules, a task file and paths that must not change. Every row has a regression test: [docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md](./docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md) #77–95.

### Added
- **Tamper-evident audit log.** Every `.agent-flow/audit.jsonl` line carries `prev` and `hash` (SHA-256 over the previous hash and the line), written under a lock. `agent-flow audit verify [--anchor <hash>]` reports the first edited, deleted, inserted or reordered line and exits 1; `audit head` prints the hash to record in a commit or CI; `audit summary` counts guard blocks per role and rule, escalations, rounds per issue and role-run cost. Logs written before 1.1.4 verify as "from before chaining". Tamper-evident is not tamper-proof: anchor the head somewhere the agent can't write.
- **Gates.** A manifest `gates` list (`name`, `command` as a string or an argv array, `cwd`, `timeout_seconds`, `expect_exit`, `required`) that the orchestrator runs with `agent-flow gates run [--name a,b] [--issue n]`. Each run leaves a log, its SHA-256, a JSON report and an audit line; exit 1 = a required gate failed, 2 = a gate couldn't run at all (fix the environment, don't spend a review round). The manifest is read from the main checkout, so a branch can't edit the gate that judges it, and `reviewer`/`qa` can't run `gates run`. The orchestrator skill runs gates before QA.
- **Manifest `policy` rules.** `max_changed_files`, `max_diff_lines`, `forbid_patterns` (a regex over added lines, optionally scoped to paths) and `require_tests` (changes under these paths need a change under those). `classify --fail-on-policy` checks the branch diff, including untracked files; the pre-commit hook checks the staged content. `classify --fail-on-heuristic` fails when no `risk_boundaries` exist, so CI can refuse to trust a path-name guess.
- **SARIF 2.1.0.** `doctor --sarif` and `audit-risk --sarif` for GitHub code scanning (file and line locations, no secret values).
- **`action.yml`.** A composite GitHub Action (`uses: Drix10/agent-flow@v1.1.4`) that runs `doctor`, `audit-risk --fail-on-new` and `classify --fail-on-protected --fail-on-policy`, and can upload SARIF. It has not run on GitHub yet: the commands it calls are covered by tests, the YAML wrapper is not.
- **Docs can't drift from the CLI.** `npm test` fails when a doc or skill names an `agent-flow` command or flag that doesn't exist, or a backticked repo path that isn't there.

### Security
- **Protected directories.** `dir/**` matches `dir` itself, and `rm`/`mv`/`find -delete` of a protected directory or any parent of one (up to `rm -rf .` and `rm -rf .git`) is blocked for every session. Brace expansion, `git -C dir`, and `tar -C`/`unzip -d` destinations are resolved like any other write. A directory too large to inspect is assumed to hold a protected path.
- **Whole-tree git rewrites** (`reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `stash`, `checkout .`/`-f`, `restore .`, and targeted `checkout`/`restore`/`rm`/`mv` that reach a protected path) are blocked while `protected_paths` is set.
- **Guard wiring, hooks and manifest are off limits** to every session: `.git/hooks/*`, `CONTEXT_MANIFEST.json`, `.claude/settings*.json` and the installed agent-flow can't be edited, deleted, moved or `chmod`-ed by an agent (a human overrides with `AGENT_FLOW_ALLOW_PROTECTED=1`). `chmod -x file` is parsed as a mode, not an option.
- **Protection is a floor.** `protected_paths` and `deny_read` committed to `HEAD` or to the default branch still apply if the manifest is deleted, emptied, or weakened on a feature branch.
- **The guard fails closed** on its own errors (unreadable input, a crash) whenever a manifest exists on disk or at `HEAD`, or `AGENT_FLOW_GUARD_STRICT=1`; the Pi hook does the same. Only an unconfigured session is left alone. The guard no longer throws on a command whose first word is `constructor`, which used to fail open.
- **Secrets stay out of context.** Real env files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env2`, `.env_prod`, `prod.env`, …) and manifest `deny_read` paths can't be read by an agent through the shell (`cat`, `grep`, `source`, `< .env`, `--env-file=`, `curl -F f=@.env`, `git show HEAD:.env`, `mv`/`ln`/`cp`) or a read tool; `AGENT_FLOW_ALLOW_SECRET_READ=1` (a human) lifts it. The installed hook matcher now includes `Read`, `NotebookRead`, `Grep` and `Glob`, so the rule actually runs in Claude Code.
- **Remote pushes.** Git-host MCP tools (`push_files`, `create_or_update_file`, `delete_file`) can't write to the default branch or with no branch named, are checked against protected paths, and pipeline roles can't `merge_pull_request`.
- A gitignore-style `protected_paths` entry with a leading slash (`/config/`) matches; it used to protect nothing. `bootstrap_write` refuses `AGENT_STATE.md` and manifest `protected_paths`, like every other write tool.
- The secret scanner finds credentials assigned to secret-named variables (`APCA_API_SECRET_KEY=…`, `FRED_API_KEY=…`, `password = "…"`) while skipping placeholders, config references and identifiers.

### Changed
- **Existing files are preserved.** `bootstrap_write` on an existing file keeps its line endings, BOM and manifest indentation, saves a backup under `.agent-flow/backups/`, shows the human what is removed, and refuses a manifest that drops `protected_paths`, `risk_boundaries` or any other existing key. `repair` keeps the manifest's indentation and line endings and takes a lock. `install --harness claude` keeps a user's other hooks in a shared matcher group, won't import a symlinked `CLAUDE.md` into itself, and refuses a malformed `hooks` shape. `hook install` treats only its own header as "ours" and backs up a foreign hook on `--force`. `init` no longer generates an `AGENTS.md` beside a `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`/`.cursorrules` that already holds rules, and suggests `protected_paths` from directories that exist (it writes none).
- **Secret scanner allowlist.** `agent-flow:allow-secret` on or above a line, or `secret_scan.ignore_paths` in the manifest, exempts a known fake (agents writing files can't use the marker). The pre-commit check reads staged files through one `git cat-file --batch` instead of a process per file.
- **Scans use git's file list** when it is available (tracked plus untracked-not-ignored files), so untracked gitignored trees are not walked: a scan of a repo with a 7 GB ignored `data/` directory no longer takes minutes. Outside git, or when the root isn't the repository's top level, they fall back to a directory walk. Tracked files are always scanned. Ignored env files are no longer reported as "present in the working tree".
- **CI checkouts.** `classify` falls back to `origin/<default>` when a detached PR checkout has no local default branch; `doctor` finds context files that are symlinks to a file in the repo (links out of the repo are ignored).
- `scan` recognises C/C++ (CMake, ctest, GoogleTest, Catch2), PHP, Swift, Elixir and Dart.
- `state_update` bounds `phase` (80) and `reason` (2000) for the CLI too; `reopen` can't target `Completed`.
- `tests/redteam/corpus.json`: a table of blocked, allowed and documented-gap cases that `npm test` runs, and `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` for pre-commit.com users.
- GitHub Packages publish runs the test suite first, like the npm publish.

### Fixed
- Paths inside the repo that begin with `..` (`..data/`) are no longer treated as outside it.
- `schema`/`report` with a prototype-named role (`toString`) and a bare `state update --round` are usage errors instead of a crash / a silent round 1.
- `pyproject.toml` dependencies after an extras bracket (`requests[security]`) and `[project.optional-dependencies]` are audited.
- Repeated `git -C a -C b` accumulates; the git file list keeps literal backslashes in POSIX names and drops paths that leave the repo through a symlinked directory.

### Docs
- New [docs/ADOPTION.md](./docs/ADOPTION.md): what agent-flow writes and when, layered adoption, what the guard does not do, and which backstops belong outside the agent. README, SECURITY, FAILURE_MODES, HARNESS-MATRIX and TRUST_LOOP describe the Claude Code `agent-flow guard` hook, what the audit log records and the real install targets; ROADMAP lists what command-text analysis cannot close (OS sandbox, orchestrator-run gates, tamper-evident audit log, run budgets, richer policy, SARIF/Action) instead of implying it.

### Upgrading from 1.1.2
- **Re-run `npx @drix10/agent-flow install --harness claude`** to widen the hook matcher (reads and MCP tools) in an existing `.claude/settings.json`; your other hooks are kept.
- Agents can no longer read env files by default. If a workflow needs it, launch with `AGENT_FLOW_ALLOW_SECRET_READ=1`, or keep the file out of the guard's path list by design (`deny_read` is opt-in for other paths).
- While `protected_paths` is set, `git reset --hard`, `git stash`, `git clean -f` and friends are refused for agents; name the files, or use the human override.
- Committing a weaker `CONTEXT_MANIFEST.json` no longer lowers protection; lowering it takes `AGENT_FLOW_ALLOW_PROTECTED=1` and a merge to the default branch.
- `init` and `scan` skip untracked gitignored trees; tracked files are still scanned.
- New manifest keys (`gates`, `policy`) are optional; a manifest without them behaves as before. `doctor` now reports a malformed `gates` or `policy` as a schema problem.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-09-28

### Security
- Bare `git push` (no refspec) is blocked: git would have pushed the checked-out branch, default branch included. Dry runs and tag-only pushes are unaffected.
- `git fetch` with a `<src>:<dst>` refspec is blocked: it rewrites local branches while looking like a read. Plain fetches only move remote-tracking refs and stay allowed.
- `git update-ref` and non-list `git replace` are blocked: direct ref and object rewrites outside every branch protection here.

### Fixed
- `state show` / `state update` with a bare `--issue` no longer silently target issue 1; a missing `--manifest` value no longer leaks a `TypeError`; `--reason` keeps values containing `=`.
- `repairStale` types extensionless paths by the filesystem instead of the name.
- Launch commands use only flags the supported CLIs offer; Codex's strict-schema output and read-only sandbox, and Pi's read-only tool list, verified against live sessions.
- Root `plugin.json` version corrected to 1.1.1; removed a README badge pointing at a directory the package was never listed in.

Full list with a regression test per row: [docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md](./docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md) rows #67–76.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-28

A pre-integration review (three independent reviewers plus a QA sweep of ~200 everyday commands) found and fixed audit rows #37–66: guard bypasses and false positives, a fail-open on an unparseable manifest, a lock race, and a Codex/Gemini pipeline that would not have run. Details and a regression test per row: [docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md](./docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md).

### Added
- **Zero-setup `doctor`.** With no manifest it finds every context file (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, `.cursorrules`, Copilot and Windsurf rules), checks every path they mention, and suggests the likely rename ("did you mean …?").
- **`agent-flow init`** writes a starter manifest (and an honest AGENTS.md skeleton if there is none) without an LLM.
- **Runnable pipeline on four harnesses:** strict JSON schemas for Codex (`schema --strict`), Gemini envelope unwrapping, background role runs with timeouts, crash resume, idempotent PRs, per-launch budgets and an audit line per role run (`report --harness`).
- Unknown commands, flags and harness names get a "did you mean" instead of a help dump.

### Security
- No agent session, pipeline role or not, may skip hooks (incl. abbreviated `--no-verif`), force-push, delete remote branches or push to the default branch.
- Read-only roles can't mutate pipeline state through the CLI twins; one allow list serves the shell guard and the CLI.
- A present-but-unparseable manifest fails closed for writes instead of disabling protection.
- Non-ASCII filenames no longer skip the pre-commit hook; `.risk-baseline.json` is tamper-proof; implementer shell writes are checked against the worktree (best-effort).

### Fixed
- Guard false positives: commit messages, echo text and grep patterns naming a protected path; `git config`; read-only git/tee/curl forms for reviewer and QA.
- `withLock` race and crash-left empty locks; prose drift false positives; typed manifest validation; `max_review_rounds` must be 1–5.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-27

A self-audit found that several documented guarantees were prose rather than code, and that the code had security bugs. This release fixes them. A second, adversarial pass before the first tag found five more (round-cap bypass, a glob-matching gap in the guard, a lock-staleness race, and two minor path/regex bugs) plus a deploy gap where two GitHub-native files had silently reverted to their v1.0.2 content, and a Windows-only CI failure traced to a missing `.gitattributes`. Full list: [docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md](./docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md).

### Security
- **Fixed shell injection** in `worktree_create`. `baseBranch` was interpolated into a shell string. All git calls now use `execFile` with validated refs.
- **Fixed path traversal** in `bootstrap_write`. Writes are confined to the repo, can't escape through symlinks, and are limited to context-file types.
- **Removed `npx ctxlint`**, which could download and execute a package. A locally installed ctxlint runs only on request.
- **Confirmation is real.** `CONFIRM_*` strings (which the model could read and supply itself) are replaced by a Pi UI dialog. Headless writes need `AGENT_FLOW_HEADLESS_WRITES=1`.
- **Claude Code and Gemini reviewer definitions no longer grant a shell.** A shell can write files, so "read-only" wasn't true. Codex reviewer uses `sandbox_mode = "read-only"` via `codex exec --sandbox read-only` or a `--profile` (see below — the initial `[agents.reviewer]` config.toml syntax was corrected before release).
- **Secret detection** in the risk audit, bootstrap and pre-commit hook. Values are never printed.
- **`state_update`'s round cap could be bypassed.** `reopen: true` rewound the round counter on any session, not just a `Completed` one — a way to dodge the auto-escalation to `Needs Me` that rounds are supposed to guarantee. Now gated on the session actually being `Completed`.
- **The guard's shell check missed leading-wildcard `protected_paths`** (`*.env`, a globbed `secrets` pattern) because it only matched a pattern's literal *prefix*, which is empty for those. Now matches any literal chunk of the pattern.
- **`withLock` could break a live holder's lock**, not just a crashed one's — it only checked file age, with no way to tell the two apart. The lock now carries its holder's PID and is broken the moment that PID is confirmed dead, with age kept only as a fallback.

### Added
- **Guard** (`extensions/guard.ts`). Pi `tool_call` hook with role-based enforcement via `AGENT_FLOW_ROLE`:
  - reviewer/qa read-only;
  - implementer worktree confinement;
  - protected paths;
  - tamper-proof state files;
  - no `--no-verify`, force-push, push to the default branch, re-roling or nested agents.
  Closes FM-16 on Pi.
- **`risk_classify`** tool and `agent-flow classify`. Mechanical risk from the real diff (replaces a JS snippet the model was asked to "run").
- **`agent-flow` CLI** (zero dependencies): `doctor`, `audit-risk`, `baseline accept`, `classify`, `check-staged`, `state`, `worktree`, `scan`, `install --harness`, `hook install`.
- **Pre-commit hook**: protected paths, secrets, broken context references.
- **Prose drift detection**: every `backticked/path` in context files is checked. Checks are case-exact on Windows and macOS.
- `schemas/context-manifest.schema.json`. The manifest is validated on write (FM-17).
- `.agent-flow/audit.jsonl`: guard blocks, confirmations, state transitions.
- FM-19 (prompt injection), FM-20 (unattended writes), FM-21 (parallel state corruption).

### Changed
- **Context files are now `AGENTS.md`** (root + per module). No harness auto-loads `Root_AGENT.md`. Claude Code imports it through `CLAUDE.md`.
- **State machine** validates transitions, keeps rounds monotonic, auto-escalates above `pipeline.max_review_rounds`, requires a reason for Needs Me, and records history. Writes are locked and atomic, at the main repo root.
- **Risk audit**:
  - every dependency is a surface, so new dependencies are detected (v1.0 missed them in existing manifests);
  - parses npm, pip, pyproject, Go, Cargo and Bundler manifests;
  - word-bounded, line-level patterns;
  - nested `node_modules` and tests are ignored;
  - the baseline is never silently wiped.
- **Worktrees**:
  - the default branch is detected (not hardcoded `main`/`develop`);
  - leftover branches are reused;
  - removal refuses to discard uncommitted work and keeps the branch;
  - the list comes from git;
  - `.worktrees/` is excluded locally.
- **Orchestrator skill**:
  - separate process per role, with the concrete launch command for Claude Code (`claude -p`), Codex CLI (`codex exec`) and Pi (`pi -p`) shown side by side, not just documented for Pi;
  - artifact packets;
  - the Reviewer is launched read-only: `--tools read,grep,find,ls` (Pi), the `reviewer` subagent (Claude Code, `tools: Read, Grep, Glob`), `--sandbox read-only` (Codex CLI);
  - QA flake re-run and a tree-mutation check;
  - draft PRs for critical changes;
  - opt-in auto-merge;
  - untrusted-issue handling.
- **`install --harness`** now also targets `windsurf`, and is tested for every target (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `cursor`, `copilot`, `windsurf`, `agents`), not just `claude`: `--dry-run` writes nothing, `--force` overwrites, re-running is a no-op. Claude Code and Codex CLI are the primary, most-tested targets; Pi remains fully supported but is no longer the lead example in the docs. Any other [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md)-reading tool (Aider, Zed, Warp, JetBrains Junie, RooCode, Amp, opencode, goose, and more) already gets drift detection and risk classification from the CLI unmodified — see [docs/HARNESS-MATRIX.md](./docs/HARNESS-MATRIX.md).
- **Implementer skill**: commits *before* diffing. v1.0 diffed first (an empty diff) and committed `diff.patch` into the branch.
- `detect_harness` reports Pi as the runtime and lists configured harnesses, instead of guessing from folder names.
- `pi.extensions` names the compiled `extensions/index.js` explicitly. Verified with Pi's own loader: 14 tools, 2 hooks, no errors.
- Zero runtime dependencies (removed `glob`, `yaml`, `zod`; `typebox` is supplied by Pi).
- CI runs on Linux, macOS and Windows. Added `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`) — its absence was letting `actions/checkout` on `windows-latest` rewrite every text file to CRLF, which broke an exact `\n`-anchored regex in the skill-frontmatter test. Windows-only, deterministic, and unrelated to any of this release's actual code; see [docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md](./docs/AUDIT-v1.1.md).

### Removed
- `pi run …` npm scripts and skill references. `pi run` is not a Pi command.
